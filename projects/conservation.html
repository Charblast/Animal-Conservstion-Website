  	    <h1>Conservation efforts</h1>
        <p>
         Various kinds of work are carried out all over the world in order to protect animal species.
         Some of them are listed below:

          <h2>Research and monitoring</h2>
          <p>
            An essential part of animal conservation is monitoring and recording 
            information about the species such as their numbers, breeding habits, etc. 
        
          </p>
          <p>
            Scientific research may be carried out to determine whether a species is 
            in decline and how to address the problem.

          <h2>Habitat protection</h2>
          <p>
            The destruction of habitat is a serious threat to many animals and 
            therefore protecting habitats is crucial to protecting the species.
          </p>
          
          <p>One example of this is the preservation of wetlands in Ireland.</p>

          <h2>Implementation of strict laws</h2>
          <p>
            Some of the laws should be made to ban the killing or capturing of endangered animals or birds. 
            It should be made a punishable offense. Such laws should be enforced strictly and should not remain on paper only.
          </p>
          <p>
            One such example of this was the Indian Wildlife Act passed by the Indian government in 1972.
