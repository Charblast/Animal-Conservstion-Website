        <p>
          
         There are animals all around the world whose numbers are in decline.
         Some of those with a high priority for conservation are:

        <h2>Snow Leopard</h2>
        <p>Snow leopards have evolved to live in some of the harshest conditions on Earth. 
           Their thick white-gray coat spotted with large black rosettes blends in perfectly with Asias steep and rocky, high mountains. 
           Because of their incredible natural camouflage, rendering them almost invisible in their surroundings, snow leopards are often referred to as the “ghost of the mountains.

        <h2>Giant Panda</h2>
        <p>High in dense bamboo forests in the misty, rainy mountains of southwestern China lives one of the world's rarest mammals: the giant panda, also called the panda.
           Only about 1,500 of these black-and-white relatives of bears survive in the wild. 
        </p>

        <p>Pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo shoots and leaves. 
           Occasionally they eat other vegetation, fish, or small animals, but bamboo accounts for 99 percent of their diets.

        <h2>Asian Elephant</h2>
        <p>
          The Asian elephant is the largest land mammal on the Asian continent. 
          They inhabit dry to wet forest and grassland habitats in 13 countries spanning South and Southeast Asia. 
          While they have preferred forage plants, Asian elephants have adapted to surviving on resources that vary based on the area.

        <h2>Blue Whale</h2>
        <p>The blue whale is the largest animal on the planet, weighing as much as 200 tons (approximately 33 elephants). 
           The blue whale has a heart the size of a Volkswagen Beetle. Its stomach can hold one ton of krill and it needs to eat about four tons of krill each day. 
           They are the loudest animals on Earth and are even louder than a jet engine.

          <h2>Black Rhino</h2>
          <p>Black rhinos are the smaller of the two African rhino species. 
            The most notable difference between white and black rhinos are their hooked upper lip. 
            This distinguishes them from the white rhino, which has a square lip. Black rhinos are browsers rather than grazers, and their pointed lip helps them feed on leaves from bushes and trees.
